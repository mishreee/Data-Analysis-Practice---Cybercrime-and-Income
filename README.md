# Data-Analysis-Practice---Cybercrime-and-Income
## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between **socioeconomic factors** (income, poverty) and **cybercrime rates** across U.S. states. Using Python, we uncover whether wealth inequality correlates with cybercrime prevalence and identify high-risk crime types.

## ðŸš€ Key Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Merged and preprocessed Census + FBI crime datasets.
- **Statistical Analysis**:
  - Hypothesis testing (Pearson/Spearman correlation, ANOVA).
  - OLS regression modeling.
- **Visualizations**: Interactive plots (scatterplots, boxplots, crime type breakdowns).
- **Reproducible Workflow**: Jupyter Notebook with step-by-step explanations.
